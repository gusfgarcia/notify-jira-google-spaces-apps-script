# Notification in google spaces of jira tickets, being able to use any field.

Using apps script google to notify changes in tickets from jira with api.

Hello, to accomplish this, you will need to create a space in google chat, or a conversation and create a webhook.

Have access to google apps script and have a jira api available.

Thx!
